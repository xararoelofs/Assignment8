Wanting that hangs in Father’s office. I graduated from New
Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father,
and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid
so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the
warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like
the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and
learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond
business so I supposed it could support one more single
man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were
choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—yees’ with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance
me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.
The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was
a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns
and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,
more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
‘How do you get to West Egg village?’ he asked.</p>

					 <h2 class="h2">Summer</h2>

I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I
was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves
growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I
had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over
again with the summer.
There was so much to read for one thing and so much
fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and
investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and
gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold
the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many
other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one
year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials
for the ‘Yale News’—and now I was going to bring back all
such things into my life and become again that most limited
of all specialists, the ‘well-rounded man.’ This isn’t just an
epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a
single window, after all. </p>
